# sign-up-form

The goal of this project is to create a simple sign-up page based on a mock-up sign up page. The main portion of this page is the sign-up form. It consists of 6 different input fields:
```
FIRST NAME
LAST NAME
EMAIL
PHONE NUMBER
PASSWORD
CONFIRM PASSWORD
```

There is a **Create Account** button at the bottom of the sign-up form. Some HTML5 form validation techniques were included in the form, such as the **required** field attribute and the correct format (i.e. example@mail.com) for the **email** input.
